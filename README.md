# edison-wiki
Here we try to salvage the pages from https://edison.internet-share.com/wiki/Main_Page which is no longer alive.

The subject is any information related to investigating the Intel Edison kernel, U-Boot, SoC hardware, ACPI, tools to build the image etc.

To view this documentation go to https://edison-fw.github.io/edison-wiki/

If you would like to contribute fork this repo now, edit on github (or locally if you prefer) and send us a PR.
